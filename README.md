s3eAdNinja
(AdMob Mediation extension)
(android is supported, iOS support will be added soon)

-----------------------------------------------------------

You can mediate ads from these providers:

•  AdMob
•	AdFonic 
•	JumpTap
•	MillenialMedia 
•	InMobi
•	MobFox
•	Hunt Mobile Ads

-----------------------------------------------------------
How to :
Set up an account in http://www.admob.com/my_sites/

all 3rdparty network libraries are built in the extension so without any change in code you can add more networks and control which network has higher priority by configuring "Ad Network Mediation" settings any time, even after the app has been released.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Setup example project:
copy examples and extension folders to 

marmalade\x.x\

run examples\s3e\s3eAdNinja.mkb to launch example app
(arm build and deploy to device, won't run in simulator)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Roadmap:
•	Support for iOS
•	Networks to be added later:
(a)	iAds
(b)	BrightRoll
•	Support for interstitial and video ads
•	Ability to hide/show and refresh ads
•	Support to specify size and type of ads to show
